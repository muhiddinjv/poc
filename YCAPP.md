**Introduction to Artisan**

Hi, I'm Jasper, co-founder and CEO of Artisan. I've always been passionate about building businesses, starting with a candy shop in my bedroom at age eight. For the past few years, I've been working with my agency of 15 people to bring new brands to market with startups and huge companies.

**Meet the Co-Founder and CTO**

Hi, I'm Rer, co-founder and CTO at Artisan. I have a strong background in machine learning, with a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Oxford and research experience at the University of California and NASA Space Telescope Science Institute. This has given me about eight and a bit years of AI/ML experience.

**Creating Digital Workers**

We're creating the first generation of true digital workers that automate job functions from end to end, which we call Artisans. These digital workers can be interacted with through chat, and they use large language models (LLMs) to automate repetitive tasks on behalf of users.

**Our Approach**

Unlike other companies that put AI into their SaaS products, we put SaaS into AI. Our first Artisan, AA, automates the entire outbound sales process. Setting up AA is easy, requiring only a five-minute conversation, making it accessible to anyone, even those without prior experience with Salesforce.

**Traction and Future Plans**

We've seen a lot of interest in our product, with sales reps eager to get beta access. We're using our sales rep as a "free employee" to test and refine our workflow, which we can then apply to future generations of agents. We're excited to build a billion-dollar company and would love YC's support on this journey.

**Introduction to Bulletin**

Hi, I'm Ali Creek Smith, co-founder and CEO of Bulletin. We work in retail space, making it easy for creative small businesses, like Etsy sellers, to share the cost of a storefront.

**The Problem We're Solving**

One in ten storefronts are vacant, but at the same time, there are millions of businesses that can't afford the high cost of retail space. To solve this disconnect, we created Bulletin, a sharing model for retail space, similar to what WeWork does for office space.

**Our Solution**

We perfected the model by taking over retail space, discounting it, slicing it up, and selling it off in sections. This makes it nearly impossible to find a retail space that's both cheap and available.

**Traction and Growth**

We've seen significant growth since the YC Fellowship program. We've doubled our revenue every single month since the program ended. We've also seen registered merchants go from just 20 to over 5,000. Additionally, we've expanded our team to 8 people, hired a CTO, relaunched our platform, and are almost done raising our seed round. We're excited about our progress and look forward to the future.

**Introduction to Campus Job**

Hi, I'm Liz, and I'm JJ, co-founders of Campus Job. I'm the CEO, and JJ is the CTO. Campus Job is an online marketplace that connects college students with part-time job opportunities during the school year, and helps businesses find students for short-term work.

**Traction and Growth**

In the past seven weeks, we've acquired over 20,000 users and 10,000 job listings. Our most popular job listings are campus rep roles for big companies like The New York Times, Coca-Cola, and Uber, as well as startups, including past YC startups. We're also seeing a lot of local listings, such as donut cashier or in-house demo roles at Walmart.

**Expansion and Funding**

We're currently a team of five people, and we're live at all 7,500+ postsecondary schools in the US. We've also raised about $1 million in seed funding and are working out of our investor's office in Union Square.

**Introduction to Clear Space**

Hi, I'm Oliver and I'm Royce, co-founders of Clear Space. We're building Clear Space to help people eliminate compulsive phone usage. Many people we know hate their relationship with technology and their phones, and we're no different as software engineers. We've independently hacked together Stacks, a solution to keep us from Doom scrolling and wasting our time on things we don't care about.

**The Problem We're Solving**

Clear Space is the solution to this problem. It helps users eliminate compulsive phone usage and focus on what's important.

**Traction and Growth**

Clear Space has already saved over 500,000 wasted scrolling sessions for users.

**Our Vision**

We would love YC's help building and scaling our vision. We want to spend the next decade of our lives working on this problem and creating a better future for everyone.

**Introduction to Clippido**

Hi, I'm Michael, the technical co-founder at Clippido, and I'm a graduate student at Hasselt University, studying computer science. My background is in building and selling multiple web application platforms to other companies.

**Meet the Business Co-Founder**

Hi, I'm Maxim, a business engineer, and I handle sales and marketing for Clippido. My background includes various management positions at different companies, such as vice president or IT manager.

**How We Met and Started Clippido**

Maxim and I met while organizing the TEDx event in Belgium, where we were both lead organizers. We started Clippido because we believe that every company is becoming a media company, but existing software doesn't support this. We saw a gap in the market, with solutions being too expensive or too complex.

**Our Solution**

We focus on finding relevant content and sharing it, which is why we founded Clippido. We hope to meet you at YC and thank you for considering us.

---------------





**Introduction to Fixc**

Hi, I'm Han, and I worked in software engineering at Facebook and as a summer associate at Bain Capital Ventures. I'm H, and I worked in software engineering at Duolingo.

**Our Background and Experience**

Honi and I first met in our sophomore year at Cornell, where we built a graduation requirements tracker that scaled to over 3,000 monthly active users. In our junior year, we co-founded a community platform startup called People, which grew to service over 110 businesses and ultimately got acquired by Triy.

**Our New Venture: Fixc**

We're now seniors and co-founders of Fixc, an intelligent developer tool for non-developers. Fixc helps non-developers gain the technical skills they need to understand code, whether they're working with an unfamiliar code base or a new programming language.

**Traction and Progress**

We started building Fixc 20 days ago, and by day two, we'd interviewed 22 potential users. By day 10, we launched on Product Hunt and placed as the number one product of the day. As of now, we have over 1,300 users and $240 in MRR. We're hoping to get a reason to drop out of college and focus on Fixc full-time.

**Introduction to Flip**

Hi, I'm Kamar, a former Google and Apple engineer, now focused on my own startup called Flip. Flip is a mobile platform that facilitates the fastest guaranteed resale on specialty items, starting with limited edition sneakers.

**Why Sneakers?**

I'm a sneakerhead, and I know the huge shadow economy surrounding sneakers. I've been a sneakerhead for as long as I've been coding, and I wrote a couple of bots that powered a six-figure business I co-founded called Prestige in the Bay Area.

**The Problem We're Solving**

With Flip, we're trying to facilitate something that scratches at the human behavior and psychology of wanting to liquidate assets extremely quickly. I know firsthand the pain of trying to sell sneakers on eBay, Craigslist, and social media like Instagram, dealing with fees and uncertainty.

**Our Goal**

We want to make it easy for people to quickly and guaranteedly resell their specialty items, starting with limited edition sneakers.

**Introduction to Haddock**

Hi, I'm Akash, a product engineer at Asana and Blend Labs. I'm Mitch, an engineer from Amazon, and we're the co-founders of Haddock. We met on Co-Founder Match.

**Our Background and Experience**

Haddock is a platform that helps Travelers create itineraries based on their preferences within seconds. We are giving Travelers the power to customize their own experiences and collaborate with friends on their trips. Every year, over 1.4 billion people arrive and internationally at an airport, just like this one. A person spends 10 hours on average planning a holiday trip, and that's a lot of time spent on tiresome planning at Haddock.

**Our Solution**

We want to make travel easy and fun. At Haddock, we use the latest advancements in AI to create a platform that's holistic. It's a platform where people can collaborate with friends and also a platform that Travelers can use on the go to create itineraries and trips based on their preferences. We've got over 500 trips created by people around the world, and we want to make that membership exciting.

**Introduction to the Founders**

Hi, I'm Jane, the creator of A Taste of Cocoa, where I work with different brands and companies in the food and lifestyle space. I also hosted the largest food court at South by Southwest with over 20,000 participants. Hi, I'm Eric, and I've started two different photography companies in the past. I'll be the developer for our startup.

**The Problem We're Solving**

Our startup, Hit Metal, came from my experience as a first-time homeowner. I was overwhelmed with the responsibility of managing and keeping track of everything. I asked my friends who had also recently bought their first homes for advice, and they told me to just store all the manuals in a plastic bag. We figured there had to be a better solution.

**Our Solution**

We envisioned a platform that's like TurboTax for home management. Just as TurboTax simplified the tax filing process, we want to simplify the process of managing a home for first-time homeowners. There's a lot of paperwork to keep track of, not just for tax season, but for the life of the home, which can be 10 years or more. We believe technology can help us handle this complexity and make it easier for homeowners to manage their homes.

**Introduction to the Team**

Hi everyone, my name is Isar, and I'm a civil engineer at Utah State University. I'm passionate about making our world more sustainable. I'm the lead engineer for the LE platform, where I've designed calculations, estimations, and mathematical formulas to determine the sustainability of projects and infrastructure, and their impact on the environment.

**Carlos' Role and Passion**

Hi, my name is Carlos, and I'm a junior analyst programmer working on the LE project. I really enjoy working on this project because it's a great way to protect and preserve our environment. I envision LE as a tool to enhance our ability to make sustainable decisions.

**Introduction to Lolli Puff**

Hi, my name is Faye Dial. I've noticed that many women pay high prices for luxury items at boutiques, even when they're available for much lower prices online, due to concerns about authenticity. On the other hand, many sellers are hesitant to list luxury items online due to false counterfeit claims. Consignment stores are often the only option, but they charge high fees.

**Our Solution**

Lolli Puff aims to be the online auction site for designer items, ensuring that items are authentic and in the possession of the seller. This is crucial for both buyers and sellers. We've already tested our concept on a blog, with hundreds of successful transactions, and have built a community of bidders, buyers, and sellers, as well as a valuable email list and a strong web reputation.

**Meet the Team**

Hi, I'm Travis Dial, a Python expert and Django web developer with a background in robotics. Hi, I'm Dave, a programmer since age 10, and it's still my passion. We're excited to introduce Lolli Puff and hope to be one of the lucky few selected.

**Introduction to Mess**

Hey guys, we're Mess, a social community for finding things to do on demand. I'm Keusha, and I'm Victor, two former roommates from UC Berkeley. We met in school and are now teaming up to solve a common problem we've faced.

**The Problem We're Solving**

We often found ourselves with nothing to do and got bored enough to want to create an app to solve this issue. In simple terms, we struggled to find things to do in the moment with people around us.

**Our Solution**

We've created a platform that opens the door to local interactions that might otherwise be discovered through word of mouth. This includes things like runners groups, local house parties, or study groups. Think of our app as Craigslist meets TikTok, where you can see all local community posts in one area, easily navigate, and pick up an event or activity on the spot.

**Introduction to Nightflyer**

Hello, my name is Brandon Bourne, and I am the President and founder of Nightflyer, a customer acquisition service for nightlife venues.

**Meet the Team**

Hi, I'm Brian Bourne, Nightflyer's Technical Director. I've been passionate about coding since the age of 12, when Brandon introduced me to LEGO Mindstorms. I've led programming teams at three startups, including Nightflyer, and I'm also in charge of snacks.

**Brandon's Role**

While Brian handles the technical aspects, my role has shifted to the business sphere. Although it wasn't part of my original plan when I was getting my master's degree in engineering, I've enjoyed learning about sales, marketing, and fundraising. This experience has been a tremendous opportunity, and I'm excited to see where we can take Nightflyer. I believe we have a winning product that can expand to the rest of the United States within the next five or six years, filling a much-needed gap in the market. Thank you for your time.

**Introduction to Funwise**

Hi, my name is Henry, and I'm the CEO of Funwise. Hi, I'm Nick, also CEO of Funwise.

**The Problem We're Solving**

In our journey, we discovered that one of the biggest challenges for modern tech recruiters is sourcing qualified tech candidates. These candidates are often already employed and have outdated CVs. Additionally, people dislike writing CVs, which forces recruiters to be "head hunters," making numerous phone calls, extracting information, and manually updating CVs.

**Our Solution**

This is where Funwise comes in. We have an AI solution that automatically extracts vital information about a candidate's experience, skills, and education from phone voice conversations. Our system then updates CVs in seconds. We currently have an MVP and first pilot clients, and we're excited to continue our journey with Y Combinator. Thanks for watching!

**Meet the Team**

Hi, I'm Aaron, a technology leader at Microsoft with a unique background in designing scrapers, building airplanes, and playing college football.

Hi, I'm Keith, a seasoned front-end designer and marketer with a proven track record at leading edtech and entertainment brands. I'm also a podcast host.

Hi, I'm Kiki, a graduate student at Georgia Tech specializing in AI, and I lead back-end marketing automation teams at MailChimp.

**The Problem We're Solving**

There are over 120 million podcasts and YouTube creators, but 95% of them struggle with audience growth, brand awareness, and monetization. To produce a single episode, audio and video podcasters use more than eight apps and spend upwards of 12 hours. This approach is inefficient and drives many creators to quit, outsource, or burn out.

**Our Solution**

Podp is the fastest way to a million subscribers. Our technology removes the busy work, allowing creators to focus on what they love: telling stories, interviewing guests, and building their brand. Today, users enjoy features like episode planning and team collaboration. Tomorrow, they'll create and scale using our guest portal and AI-powered marketing tools.

**Join Us**

To have a successful podcast, you need a successful process. We're applying to solve this big problem with you. Join us and become a podcaster's best friend.

**Introduction to Purple Squirrel**

Hi, I'm John Silber, former strategy consultant at Google and now the CEO and co-founder of Purple Squirrel. I'm Jim Ericson, COO and co-founder of Purple Squirrel.

**The Problem We're Solving**

Everyone knows that when it comes to getting a job, it's not what you know, it's who you know. Those without great connections are at a tremendous disadvantage. Purple Squirrel solves this problem by connecting job seekers with inside connections at leading companies, dramatically increasing their chances of getting a job.

**Our Solution**

Employees get paid to help, not HR. We've validated our idea by talking to over a thousand job seekers and employees, and dozens of companies. The response has been overwhelming: "Why doesn't this exist yet?" and "Where can I sign up?" In the last 30 days, over a thousand people have already signed up.

**Meet the Team**

Let me introduce you to the rest of the team. You've already met Earl, the purple squirrel. Hi, my name is Kai Yen, and I'm the Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Purple Squirrel.

**Introduction to Remember All**

Hi, I'm Ronic, and I'm AD. We met four years ago studying computer science at MIT, and we're both second-time founders. We're building Remember All, a developer tool that gives large language models access to a longer-term memory.

**The Problem We're Solving**

I was struggling with a couple of LLM-based side projects, and I realized that memory management was a major issue. I built Remember All about three weeks ago, initially for personal use. However, after tweeting about it, I received an insane response with hundreds of thousands of views. I realized that I was onto something, and many others probably had the same problem.

**The Response**

That one tweet led to nearly 300 people reaching out and asking to use Remember All for a wide variety of use cases. We realized that remembering details about the user fundamentally changes the user experience for AI products. It allows you to turn unstructured user data into actionable user profiles, enabling more personal conversations with chatbots and better-equipped co-pilots.

**Market Validation**

We found that already 88% of AI founders are using retrieval as part of their LLM stack, and they say it will continue to be an important piece of the puzzle. Remember All can help empower builders to go even further with memory.

**Joining YC**

We'd love to join the upcoming YC batch as we build the future of AI-powered products with Remember All.

**Introduction to Suggester**

Hi YC, I'm Aditya, the business co-founder of Suggester. I handle marketing, sales, and customer support. I've been in the recommendation space for almost two years.

Hi, I'm Alexey, an AI researcher from Facebook, and co-founder and CTO of Suggester. I handle product and tech development. We both moved to Singapore to build Suggester together.

**The Problem We're Solving**

Large platforms like Amazon generate 25-30% of their total sales from product recommendations. However, for smaller brands, this figure is often in the 4-7% range. This represents a huge lost revenue opportunity.

**Outdated Technology**

Most Shopify stores use the same outdated algorithm from 1992, called collaborative filtering, even for expensive third-party apps. We think this is insane, especially in 2021.

**Our Solution**

We use a new technology called multimodal AI, which looks at products and makes recommendations. Our solution works for small stores, large stores, and everything in between.

**Results**

We recently launched our Shopify app store and onboarded 17 DTC brands in just three weeks. For these brands, we generated over $7,000 in additional sales from recommendations.

**Conclusion**

Thank you, we are Suggester, and we look forward to telling you more about the business we're building.

**Introduction to Teespring**

Hi Y Combinator, I'm Walker Williams, and I'm Evan S. Clayton, co-founders of Teespring. Teespring allows users to crowdfund custom apparel with an all-or-nothing crowdfunding model.

**Traction and Growth**

We've gone from our minimum viable product to over $600,000 in revenue in just 8 months, with over $150,000 of that in the last month alone. We're growing, but we want to accelerate our growth to the speed of a Y Combinator company.

**Unique Approach**

We've achieved this growth without spending any marketing dollars. Our approach has been successful, and we've even received buyout offers from two of the biggest competitors in our space.

**Request to Join Y Combinator**

We're excited about the potential of Teespring and want to take it to the next level. We believe that joining the Y Combinator Spring program will help us achieve this goal. We're eager to work with the Y Combinator team to accelerate our growth and eventually crowdfund the world.

**Introduction to Toddle**

Hi, I'm Bennett Fin, and I've worked in enterprise software sales for over 8 years, most recently at Microsoft and Oracle. I'm Brandon Harding, a data scientist, and we're the co-founders of Toddle.

**How We Met**

Bennett had the opportunity to meet me through YC's co-founder matching program, after speaking with about 50 other potential matches. We live close to each other and have been working on Toddle day and night.

**The Problem We're Solving**

I first came across this problem when my wife and I were expecting a baby girl and needed to find full-time daycare for her. The process of collecting information about local schools and enrolling was really difficult.

**Traction and Progress**

Over the last six weeks, we've acquired four new customers, and we're extremely excited about the future. We're hoping to partner with YC to take Toddle to the next level.

**Request to Partner with YC**

We believe that Toddle has the potential to make a significant impact, and we'd love the opportunity to work with YC to make that happen. Thank you!
